# Summary

※ Zig-zag problem
If your nozle diameter is 0.4mm, set your extusion width 0.45mm to avoid zig-zaging behavoir on wall construction and reduce overall print time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

※ Attention to Ender3 Pro Users.
I dont know why people have different length between extrusions (102~105mm varies) but I got Ender3 Pro version yesterday and mine says it is 105mm length.
Drew scale and it fits perfectly as seen on the picture I uploaded.
But as I said, not really sure if it fits to your ender3 since everyone has different dimensions, I decided to upload Fusion360 type of file you can just modify the sizes as you want.
Good luck everybody.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


** ENDER 3 Pro version is on the way.
Just ordered machine and drawer will be my first project.
sorry for pro users who printed and failed to fit in... I didnt intend make you a beta tester.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

just a simple top sealed drawer with V-slot for ender3 machine.
test printed and it is good to go.
have fun printing^^
