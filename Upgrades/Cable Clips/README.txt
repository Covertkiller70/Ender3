# Summary

Remix from jn-gr's ribbon cable clip for the Ender 3 - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2880021

The original clips are good but quite a loose fit and can be very difficult to get off if need be. These tweaks solve both issues and, as a bonus, you can use them on the PSU power cable as well.

The clip now has 45 degree fillers on the inside of the arms as well as small tags on the outside. To remove, just place a flat blade (screwdriver) behind the tag and lever against the aluminium extrusion - the clip will pop off.
The clip has also been modified to accept the 2 x 3mm power wires from the PSU.

Also included is a 90 degree clip, designed to anchor the ribbon cable where it crosses an extrusion. See photos.
This clip has shorter arms than the other one (therefore less flex) and consequently it's a bit harder to get on and off.

The clips attach to the centre section of 4040 aluminium extrusion so will suit any printer with that size framing.

Print on their side as per the STLs for maximum strength.  This does create a weak point with the extension on the 90 degree clip however there should be no tension on this part (unless you use it to lever the clip off..). 

Modified/modelled in Sketchup. The SKP files are included if you wish to modify the designs - you can export as an STL with the free extension from the Warehouse.
