# Summary

Cute mini Octopus, articulated and printed without supports.

It's designed so it can be printed at once, no assembly required.

4 different STL files available:

- Octopus_v5.5.stl ---> No support added (use your own, just for the mouth).
- Octopus_v5.5_support.stl ---> Support added for the mouth. Just slice and print. (Doesn't work for all printers).

Not tested:

- Octopus_v5.5_spiral.stl ---> Same than above, but tentacles in spiral to save space (not tested yet, but you should probably print at a larger scale).
- Octopus_v5.5_spiral_support.stl ---> Same than above, support added.

If you don't have a 3D printer, you can also get one (https://www.fabshop3d.com/)

# Print Settings

# How I Designed This

Tentacles designed with Fusion 360.
Head designed with Meshmixer.
