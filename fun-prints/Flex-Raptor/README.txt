# Summary

<p> A flexible velociraptor!  How cool!  This is a very flexible (19 joints!), print-in-place model I spent a long time designing.  A lot of attention to detail in this model, and a few of the smaller tail links are weak due to their size so be careful!  He can stand on his own or hang from something; he can even bite his own tail! <s>One of the links just behind his hip will be a little stiff after the print and will just take a little careful working to get completely flexible, otherwise</s> (fixed) He should print and pop off the board in a completely flexible state.  He seems happiest when hanging from a computer monitor.  Have fun! Kudos to <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2738211">
DrLex</a>, <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1759297">
Kirbs</a> and <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2189652">
airfish</a> for developing the link mechanic used in this model</p>

**not suitable for small children, the tail end pieces may be fragile and could break off and be swallowed**

<i>updates 5-10-18: 
- <i> improved feet to stand better
- <i> improved tail positioning to print without binding
- <i> these changes have been verified 5/11/18

<i>updates 6-16-18: 
- <i> improved strength of end tail pieces
- <i> flattened top of angled tail parts for a better surface finish
- <i> use file "STRONGER TAIL" 
- <i> these changes have been verified 6/16/18

<i>Update 7-25-18: wow 1000 likes, you guys are awesome!

<i>Update 7-29-18:
- <i> verified model can be printed up to 175% scale without issue
- <i> verified model can be printed down to 65% scale and retain flexibility but requires substantial care and effort to coerce joints to become completely flexible.  I attribute this to clearance being reduced.  Recommended minimum scale: 75% with a good printer, 100% with a poorly tuned printer. 

<i>Update 3-4-19:
- <i> added a new two-part design with the tail separate so larger prints are possible
- <i> verified model can be printed up to 325% scale if using the split files
- <i> added images showing scales of 65%, 100%, 125%, 175% and 325%
- <i> verified model can be printed in PETG
- <i> thank you all so much for your support!

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Prusa
Printer: i3 MK3
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: .2mm
Infill: 12% minimum if rectalinear, 20% minimum otherwise
Filament_brand: Hatchbox
Filament_material: PLA, PETG

Notes: 
Make sure you print him on his RIGHT SIDE.  His tail is tapered and I designed him so that his tail sits flat with the right side of his body for printability.  No supports or rafts are needed.  I used 210° first layer temp, 205° printing temp, 60° bed temp for best results.  My printer is dialed in well; if you experience issues I suggest printing at least 125% scale, slow down a little and try slightly higher or lower temperatures.  

# Post-Printing

No post-printing needed!  This model is designed to be printed without supports or rafts.
