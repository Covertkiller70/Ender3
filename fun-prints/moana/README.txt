# Summary

Printed one of the originals of these for my niece for Christmas which turned out great, but saw in the comments someone asking for a joined version to print vertically. So I ran it through MeshLab to greatly reduce it's complexity, joined the halves in TinkerCad, and after some trial and error had a version that's 5x smaller in filesize, and seems to have printed relatively well on it's side with a brim and supports, though lost a little detail on the side I had down.

# Print Settings

Printer: Monoprice Select Mini v1
Rafts: No
Supports: Yes
Resolution: 0.0875
Infill: 10%

Notes: 
I actually rotated it 90 degrees clockwise from the orientation in the file to try and have it sit on the side with less details right near the edge for the print in the picture.

# Post-Printing

Had to do a little clean-up of the brim area with x-acto knife and some sandpaper after taking off the supports and brim, probably would have been better with a raft.
