# Summary

Battletech model of a RVN-3L "Raven" Mech. 

________________

Exportet from Mechwarrior Online, a free to play game you can find at

The Design will also be included in the upcoming Battletech strategy game:

The original in-game Model was designed by Alex Iglesias:

_______________

I invested around 20 hours to stitch, split ,repair and remodel parts of it in Blender and OpenScad. 

 Joints are made of 4x1 mm neodymium magnets that I glued into the added dents.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: RepRap
Printer: MendelMax 1.5
Rafts: Yes
Supports: Yes
Resolution: 0.12
Infill: 15

Notes: 
0.3 mm airbrush nozzle. 1.75mm Kiboplast PLA silber

# Post-Printing

Gently remove the Supports, if you used the split Torso sand the bottom of both halves and glue them together. 

It takes 10 small (neodymium) magnets to join the parts. Alternatively just glue them together.
It is designed to hold round magnets with a diameter of 4mm and a thickness of 1mm.

# How I Designed This

Exportet from Mechwarrior Online ( www.mwomercs.com ). 

Stiched the parts and made them manifold and printable in Blender and OpenSCAD.

I changed the new dynamic weapon models back to the look of the static model and added some geometry for the joints and ecm.
